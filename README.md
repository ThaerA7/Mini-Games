# Mini-Games Collection

Just a bunch of fun browser games I built to procrastinate... I mean, to practice React and TypeScript 😄

**⚠️ Work in Progress** - Still building and polishing things, so expect bugs and incomplete features!

## 🎮 What's Inside?

### Puzzle Stuff

- **Sudoku** - You know what this is
- **Killer Sudoku** - Sudoku but harder (you're welcome)
- **Crossword** - Words in a grid, auto-generated and everything
- **Block Blast** - Kinda like Tetris but different

### Memory Games (aka Brain Melters)

- **Visual Memory** - Spot the difference but with memory
- **Sequence Memory** - Remember patterns that get stupidly long
- **Chimp Test** - Can you beat a chimpanzee? Probably not
- **Number Memory** - How many digits can you remember? Let's find out

### Geography Games (Test Your World Knowledge)

- **Flag Guess** - Name that flag!
- **Map Shape Guess** - Guess countries from their shapes (harder than it sounds)
- **Capital Guess** - Know your capitals or embarrass yourself trying
- **Currency Guess** - What do they use in [random country]?
- **Population Guess** - More people in India or Indonesia? 🤔
- **Language Guess** - What language do they speak there?
- **Emoji Country** - Because why not represent countries with emojis

## 🚀 Running This Thing

You'll need Node.js and pnpm installed. Then just:

```bash
pnpm install    # grab the dependencies
pnpm dev        # fire it up (usually on localhost:5173)
pnpm build      # if you wanna deploy it somewhere
```

## 🛠️ Built With

React 19, TypeScript, Vite, and a bunch of other cool stuff like Zustand for state, Phaser for game logic, and D3 for the map games.

## 🧪 Tests

Yeah there are tests:

```bash
pnpm test       # run 'em
pnpm test:ui    # run 'em with a fancy UI
```

## 📝 License

MIT - do whatever you want with it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
